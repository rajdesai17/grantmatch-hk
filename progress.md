# GrantMatch Project Progress Log

## Initial Setup
- Vite React + TypeScript project initialized
- TailwindCSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer configured
- Supabase client and environment variables set up
- Project structure created: src/, supabase/, data/, components/, pages/

## Core Features Implemented
- Custom router (no react-router) in src/components/utils/router.tsx
- Authentication modal and user session logic (Supabase Auth)
- Profile page with user info, votes, NFT achievements
- Grant discovery chat UI (frontend)
- Explore grants page with search and tag filters
- DAO voting page with proposals and voting UI
- Static data for grants, proposals, founders in src/data/
- Supabase migration for profiles, votes, nfts, funding_rounds tables
- Migrated 5 grants from static JSON to the Supabase 'grants' table.
- Refactored ExplorePage to fetch and display grants from Supabase instead of static data.
- Created `grant_applications` table in Supabase to track which founders have applied for which grants, including status and timestamp. This supports the new grant application and tracking features as outlined in current-task.txt and features.txt.
- Created `proposals` table in Supabase to support DAO proposal creation, listing, and voting. This enables founders to create proposals and for the DAO to track and vote on them as required by the build plan and features.txt.
- Created `proposal_votes` table in Supabase to support voting on proposals (for/against/abstain) and prevent duplicate votes per user per proposal. This enables the next step of the DAO voting system as outlined in the build plan and features.txt.
- Implemented Phantom Wallet connect (step 2):
  - Added useWallet hook in src/lib/useWallet.ts for Phantom detection, connect, disconnect, and public key state.
  - Integrated Connect Wallet/Disconnect Wallet button in Header (desktop and mobile).
  - Display connected wallet address in header.
  - Added warning banner in App.tsx if Phantom is not detected.
- Modified signout logic in Header.tsx to disconnect the wallet on user signout, ensuring wallet is only linked to the current user session.
- Improved wallet connect flow: now links wallet to user profile only after Phantom is actually connected, using callback mechanism. Prevents 'wallet or user not found' error.
- Enhanced ai-grants Edge Function: Discovery chat now returns detailed, personalized reasons for each matching grant, explaining why the user should apply based on their project description and matched keywords.

## Documentation & Rules
- Detailed build guide in follow.txt
- Build rules and documentation links in custom.mdc

## Next Steps
- Implement and deploy Supabase Edge Functions (mint-nft, ai-grants, faucet-tokens, award-winner)
- Integrate Solana Devnet for NFT minting and SPL token transfers
- Complete wallet connect and on-chain voting flows
- Finalize deployment to Vercel

## Additional Notes
- Created supabase/functions directory for Edge Functions.
- Started scaffolding required Edge Functions: mint-nft, ai-grants, faucet-tokens, award-winner.
- Scaffolded all required Edge Functions: ai-grants, mint-nft, faucet-tokens, award-winner.
- Refactored DiscoveryPage to use the ai-grants Edge Function for real AI-powered grant matching instead of demo logic.
- DiscoveryPage now always sends the Authorization header with the anon key for Supabase Edge Function requests, fixing 401 errors when JWT verification is enforced.
